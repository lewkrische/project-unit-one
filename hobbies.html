        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
 
       <h4>Cycling</h4>  
         <p>Since the end of my soccer days (about 15 years ago), I hopped back on my bike and began riding again. 
            To me, it's just about the most perfect workout.  I sweat a lot and a kind breeze helps.  I get to explore
            more of the city than I would running or driving a car. I think I've begun to appreciate architecture
            solely due to my rides</p>
        
        <h4>Business Ideas</h4>  
          <p>I've always been intrigued by the exchange of ideas and how new products and services come to market. 
            I certainly have my own and am motivated to become a better web developer, in part, to help my further 
            advance my ideas into reality.
          </p>
         
        <h4>Gardening</h4>  
          <p>I planted my first vegetable garden when I was eight years old and have had a green thumb ever since. I am 
            currently planting some apple trees and other fruit trees at the family farm, in hopes of one day producing 
            hard cider. In addition, I am going to add Fava beans to my garden for the first time. I have grown to really
            like some fava bean snack foods of recent and would like to test my hand at making my own. We'll see.
          </p>

      <h2>Hobbies continued...</h2>

        <h4>Philosophy</h4>
        <p>Ever since I took a philosophy course in college, I've always been keen to read about philosophy to learn 
          about different outlooks of how to live a good life
        </p>
        <h4>Politics</h4>
        <p>I've consistently followed politics for the past 20 years and have volunteered on occasion. I feel it's important
          to keep abreast of political news so that government can work for all Americans and help the world, at large.
        </p>
        <h4>Books</h4>
        <p>I always have a few books on my coffee table that I read. Since this pandemic, I have spent a lot of my time working 
          on home and farm projects while listening to audio books. What a treasure! What times we live in to have such
          ease to listen to most everything under the sun!
